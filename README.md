Based on https://habr.com/ru/company/unwds/blog/390601/

# Main features:
* Stand alone, no external WiFi/Internet required
* Web server based configuration. No hardware indicators/buttons required
* High power load commutation in sealed enclosure, low heat generation (triac+relay in parallel solution)
* Pretty web pages with css and svg design
* Single side circuitboard, see project at easyeda/oshwlab portal

# Installation:

## Project's references:

Check out https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-nodemcu-async-web-server-espasyncwebserver-library/ "Installing Libraries â€“ ESP Async Web Server" to install Async Web Server library. In Sloeber IDE you need to go to Arduino\"Add a source folder to the selected project" and refer to local folders with ESPAsyncWebServer and ESPAsyncTCP libraryes. If all done right, you should have it in project references:

## Last step:
Dont forget to open SecretsExample.h, set your own credentials and save it as Secrets.h.

Thats all. Compilation should runs sucesfully.
